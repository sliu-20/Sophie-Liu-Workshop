K12: ...or The Only Constant is Change?

Q0: Removing render_template from the import statement causes an error when you try to access /my_foist_template/ as it isn't defined
Q1: localhost:5000/my_foist_template/
Q2: the first argument is the file name (within the templates folder), the rest are variables for jinja2 to work with. fooooo becomes the name of the page in the browser, while collection is the list of values that flask serves when /my_foist_template/ is accessed.

Notables:
File structure
- there's the usual app.py in the root dir and in the templates folder model_tmplt.html .

When opening the template html file locally, it clearly isn't working (jinja isn't parsing it at all). {% for item in collection %}, {{ item }}, and {% endfor %} are written directly on the page. 
As app.py passes in values to render_template, it should parse it in some way. 


Results:
Everything went as expected! Hooray :)
